# chdl

Clojure Hardware Description Language

## About

CHDL (rhymes with "little") is a lisp language built on clojure which compiles
down to VHDL, the hardware description language. CHDL improves on VHDL in many
ways, primarily in allowing for much greater flexibility in code by allowing you
to use clojure's built-in functionalities to aid in generating your hardware on
the fly.

## Usage

See [the md5 example](/src/chdl_examples/md5/main_loop.clj) for usage.
